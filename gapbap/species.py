This is a script to facilitate spatial queries of the GAP species
model data.  This script provides a table that answers the question "What percentage
of each species' habitat occurs in X subset of the cells within the contiguous US?"
It compares a group of species model output rasters, to a binary raster of your choosing
that could be a reclassification of the landcover or something like a binary 30m
pixel raster of urban.

The inputs for the script are (1) a directory containing the species model grids
that you wish to assess and (2) a "subset" grid coded as "10's" and "NoData"'s.
If other values are used, the script will need to be edited.

Arc's inability to build VAT's for grids with counts over 2 billion
are problematic for this task, so I had to code in tiling of the rasters where a VAT
is built for each tile, copied to a DataFrame, and then all DataFrames are combined
with Pandas.

Some grids have negative values that don't cause any error but give erroneous results.
There is therefore, a step that tests for that so that grids with negative counts aren't
processed and are listed instead.

Initial tests of this script found inconsistent results during the processing of
tiles from splitraster_management.  The solution was to overwrite the attribute table
for each tile before processing.

Some notes from each run are recorded in a processing log at the end of the run.
The log stores the list of models with tiling problems or negative values in the
species distribution grid.
