# GAPAnalysis
A python package to facilitate common steps in analyses of GAP habitat maps.  Users will need to have local copies of GAP habitat maps with the original file names.

So far, this package can be used to create species richness maps, calculate the overlay of individual or lists of species habitat with areas of interest, reclassification of GAP land cover map (2001) to a binary map of ecological systems of interest, and miscellaneous data management or manipulation tasks.  See the documentation folder and help files for function documentation.

Help files are available in the "documentation" folder that list and document functions in each of the package's modules.
